= Kotlin/JS + Tailwind CSS =

This is a small sample repository to show the idiomatic way of configuring these two systems together.

== Running it ==

. Run `./gradlew run`.
. Open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.
. ðŸŽ‰ Notice we're using Tailwind CSS classes successfully.

== How To ==

Steps taken to make this work:

=== Dependencies ===

Add the following dependencies to your JS target (`jsMain` dependencies) in your Gradle file:

[source,kotlin]
----
implementation("org.jetbrains:kotlin-extensions:1.0.1-pre.148-kotlin-1.4.21")
implementation(npm("postcss", "8.2.6"))
implementation(npm("postcss-loader", "4.2.0")) // 5.0.0 seems not to work
implementation(npm("autoprefixer", "10.2.4"))
implementation(npm("tailwindcss", "2.0.3"))
----

* `kotlin-extensions` is necessary to get the JavaScript link:https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/blob/master/kotlin-extensions/src/main/kotlin/kotlinext/js/CommonJS.kt#L20[`require`] function.
** Make sure the version number matches your version of the Kotlin multiplatform plugin at the top of your Gradle file.
** Kotlin Multiplatform 1.4.30 gave me `No descriptor found for library` errors. Try 1.4.21.
** Find the latest versions link:https://bintray.com/kotlin/kotlin-js-wrappers/kotlin-extensions[here].
* `postcss` and `autoprefixer` are link:https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#install-tailwind-via-npm[dependencies] as mentioned in the Tailwind CSS docs.
* `postcss-loader` is required because Kotlin/JS is built on top of Webpack.
** Note that while 5.0.0 is out, using it gave me build errors. The latest 4.x seems to work.
* `tailwindcss` is obviously what we're here for.

=== Add Tailwind as a PostCSS plugin ===

Just do link:https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#add-tailwind-as-a-post-css-plugin[this step].

If unsure, create this file in your project root:

[source,javascript]
----
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
}
----

=== Create your configuration file (optional) ===

link:https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#create-your-configuration-file[Official documentation].

Creating the `tailwind.config.js` file is a little tricky because simply `npx` won't work, as we haven't installed any
`node_modules`. Fortunately, Kotlin/JS has already done this for us.

Run the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./gradlew kotlinNpmInstall
$ ( cd build/js/ && npx tailwindcss init && mv tailwind.config.js ../../ )
----

This generates `tailwind.config.js` in the `build/js/` directory and then moves it up two directories to the project
root. Kotlin/JS generates the node modules into `build/js/node_modules` when the `kotlinNpmInstall` task runs.

This assumes your JavaScript module is `js`. If it's not, you'll need to change the `cd build/js/` part. If you're not
sure where your `node_modules` directory is, run `find . -maxdepth 3 -name node_modules`.

You should now have all your dependencies set up and config files created.

=== Create and Reference a Regular CSS File ===

_If you already have a CSS file that you're loading in your app, you can skip this step._

Create `app.css` in your `jsMain/resources/` directory. Put something obvious in there so you know
when it's loaded:

[source,css]
----
body {
    background-color: red;
}
----

This file will get copied into the same folder as your transpiled JavaScript files.

In your JavaScript file (`client.kt` in this package), add:

[source,javascript]
----
kotlinext.js.require("./app.css")
----

to your `main` method. You can of course import the `require` method if you prefer.

If you run `./gradlew run`, you should be able to see a red page at `http://localhost:8080/`.

We're almost there, but we have two more steps: tell Webpack to use PostCSS and to finally inject Tailwind CSS.

=== Using PostCSS with Webpack ===

We want to "monkeypatch" the Webpack configuration that Kotlin/JS generates for us. This hook is
documented in the link:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-project-setup.html#webpack-bundling[webpack bundling] section. Basically, if we create .js files in `webpack.config.d/`, they'll be automatically
merged into `build/js/packages/projectName/webpack.config.js`, which exists after a build and you can go inspect.

The "problem", if you have `cssSupport.enabled = true` in your Gradle file (which you should!), is that this line
generates a webpack rule matching `/\.css$/`. We can't simply create another rule matching the same files...that
won't work.

So, we need to find the original rule and modify it. Create the following file relative to your project root:

[source,javascript]
----
// in webpack.config.d/postcss-loader.config.js

(() => {
    const cssRule = config.module.rules.find(r => "test.css".match(r.test));
    if (!cssRule) {
        throw new Error("Could not resolve webpack rule matching .css files.");
    }
    cssRule.use.push({
        loader: "postcss-loader",
        options: {}
    });
})();
----

We use an IIFE so that our new variable doesn't potentially interfere with other unseen variables.

Now PostCSS is working!

With PostCSS configured and the `tailwindcss` npm module in our dependencies, all that's left now
is to use it.

=== Importing Tailwind CSS ===

We're basically smooth sailing from here. Follow the link:https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#include-tailwind-in-your-css[Include Tailwind in your CSS] directions.

Just stick the following in your `app.css`:

[source,css]
----
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
----

If you start the server again, it should **Just Work**! It's a bit hard to tell, but if you check the devtools,
you should see the tw classes loading and massive js.js file being loaded (9.20mb!) which contains all of Tailwind CSS.

== Areas for Improvement ==

=== Modifications to app.css ===

Changes made to app.css don't get picked up unless you do a full `./gradlew clean` first, which is painful.

Adding the following line to build.gradle.kts seems to fix this:

[source,kotlin]
----
tasks.withType(KotlinWebpack::class.java).forEach { t ->
    t.inputs.files(fileTree("src/jsMain/resources"))
}
----

=== Getting --continuous working ===

Even with the above fix, --continuous doesn't seem to work. ðŸ¤·
